                <h2 class="bnr-sub-title">The Nuss Procedure</h2>
                <p class="bnr-para">The Nuss procedure involves a concave stainless steel bar that is slipped under the sternum with the assistance of a scope (small camera) using two small incisions on each side of the chest. The bar is then flipped, and the sternum moves to the proper position. (https://www.chop.edu/treatments/nuss-procedure)</p>
                <p class="bnr-para">The Nuss procedure is a minimally-invasive procedure, invented in 1987 by Dr. Donald Nuss for treating pectus excavatum. He developed it at Children's Hospital of The King's Daughters, in Norfolk, Virginia. The operation typically takes approximately two hours. (wikipedia)</p>
                <p class="bnr-para">Pectus excavatum can make kids feel self-conscious about the way they look. It can also make it hard for them to exercise and play sports, and cause other health problems. The Nuss procedure can improve kids' emotional and physical well-being. The recovery time can be difficult, but most kids are happy with the results. (https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/nuss-procedure.html)</p>

                <p>My procedure went rather simplistic. I arrived on scene on June 7th @ Childrens Hospital in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The team was ready, I was ready. Woke up without any complications. Got out of bed in the matter of 3 hours and started rehab instantly. I only stayed at the hospital for 1 night and left the following day which is unheard of for this procedure. I very much did not like the hospital and wanted to leave as fast as possible. (I fucking hated the yellow room (the color of my room)</p>

                <p>At the 30 day mark, complications arose. I was in more pain than before for no reason at all. After making a critical mistake by putting heat on my incisions they puffed up drastically. They were infected and life wasn't looking good. At that moment, I was rushed to the hospital and put into surgery instantly. The doctors were unsure what happened, why I was in pain and what they had to do to create a solution for me. After an incredible 10 surgeries total, the infection was cleaned and treated for. I stayed in the hospital for a total of 1-2 months throughout this process. My summer was ruined, I was devastated and absolutely hated everyone around me and life in general.

                <p>If we're being honest with ourselves. I still don't know if this experience was worth the troubles I went through. I became a darker person as a whole. No longer that happy, excited, young man but rather a quiet, calculated and disciplined individual now. I am now 19 years old and still question myself about the procedure. (btw, getting the titanium rod out of your chest is much easier. About a 1 week recovery with little to no pain compared to the titanium rod being implanted into your chest.)</p>
